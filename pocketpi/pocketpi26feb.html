          <h1>THE POCKETPI</h1>

      <H1>setting up the araspbarry getElementsByClassName();</H1>

    running pip installs and different scripts on the pi can be a little bit of a pain in the ass. 
    we have the pi running now. only it does not recognise sdl DSP audio, i think the built in audio driver in raspberrypi os is shitty. 
    when trying to instal asla though this doesnt seem to be helping much. so we might need to switch to linAudio or jack. or maybe even switch entirely to ubuntu. 
    this is only the case though if afterwards the pi still understands how to use its GPIO pins. we just need to read more tutorials online i guess.
    someone has done this and has made it work so we will too.

    in terms of hardware though something we need to look into also (i think) is the consideration of using an esp instead of a teensy due to cost effeciency. this is a concern only i might have though and probably for the prototype a teensy would be a better suitor. 
    also we need to maybe 3d print a case at least i do but then i need to get into CAD software again and this pains my ass. üçëüôÅ

something else worth noting is that sd cards and usb sticks are totally cheap nowadays
