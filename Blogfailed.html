            "How do you feel about chatgpt? " is a question im sure we're all sick of nowadays. anyways i think theyre
            pretty chill. on a train ride to alishan today me and my girlfriend were listening to a casette we bought at
            the <a href="">pandan bakery</a> and it reminded me that i actually hate spotify. i do like listening to
            music though but it did make me consider switching to an mp3 player for ease of use. <br>
            <br>
            the issue with switching i had was that i didnt know of a way to keep my library when moving. i thought a
            python script would probably be the way to go but i dont want to be figuring out spotipy while on vacation,
            especially not if my good friend chat already figured this out for me. i still want to learn spotipy one day
            though this day is just not today. though a little unethical i will still buy the music i want on bandcamp
            one day but until then its the pirate's life for me. <br>
