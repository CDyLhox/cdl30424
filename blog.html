            lately ive been obsessed with slow scan photography and videography. <br>
            thanks to artists like <a href="https://francoisvogel.com/en/film/158/Reer">Francios vogel</a>. ive
            expirimented with some slit scan stuff in p5js which i will try to append in this here canvas... <br>
            i tried for a while but this shit is going nowhere, ill make a video of the sketch instaid. <br>
            p5 in the site is something ive got to get working.

            <video controls width="30%" style="display: inline-block; float: right;" src="vid/slitscnanerd.mp4"></video>

            of course francoisvogel does this shit to the supreme and im nowhere near yet but i still find as an
            audiovisual exploration this to be an interesting technique. <br>
            Also speaking of scan techniques you CANNOT not talk about slow scan television this is my new favorite
            analogue technique made digital <br>
            it sounds amazing, distorts images in the most beautiful way and is also all round just super fun to
            mess around with. <br>

            i woke up late, it mustve been around
            lunchtime cause my roommates were making a lot of noise in the hallway. i waited a second for them to leave
            so i
            could take a pee and make myself some coffee. <br> after an hour or so my mom called me because she was
            going to
            a yoga
            seminar in utrecht (which is where i am living right now).<br> she offered to bring some of my stuff from
            utrecht
            back to my hometown of Zoetermeer. this has to happen because im moving out of my current apartment next
            month.
            <br>she picked
            me up and we drove to her seminar so i could take her car back to my apartment for free parking while she
            was
            doing her thing. the seminar lasted about 3 hours which was great cause i had to clean my bathroom. after
            picking her up, we went to pick up the stuff im bringing back to Zoetermeer. stuff like sir <a

                focussed on temporary time

                is truly mine
                a world to walk through

                its pretty cold here in my temporary home at the amsterdamsestraatweg in utrecht.
                its a cold day today and im feeling very unmotivated. 
                Good news though yesterday i talked to my good friend <a href="https://stupidplusplus.com/">Puk Bruinsma</a>, and we finally finalised Wacko_ For release
                which is a load off my shoulders by which i mean that im so happy its finally finished. <br>
                this is a project ive been working on for the past 2 years and its great to finally have something made to show to the world. <br>
            </p>
            <!-- <h2>11 nov 24</h2>
            <p class="p1">
                id like to expand a little on temporary space and what this means to me. 
                the basic idea stems from being fully alone, as a kid i spent a lot of time by myself.
                i had friends at school and i had places i could go to but with my mother working a lot and my dad not being around at the time.
                i had a lot of time to develop some ideas i was forming at the time in solitude.
                How this relates to temporary space for me is in the idea where you cant prove anything which exists outside of your head.
                your only certainty is conciousness but when you choose not to show this by speaking your ideas out loud.
                then the question to me is if these thoughts are then real for anyone else but me.
                <br>
                then came puberty and mentally life started getting more and more of a heavy burden,
                which eventually pushed me to develop a sort of dissociative state of mind.
                this combined with my ideas of temporary thought convinced me that everyone else's thoughts must be worth something, 
                they share them after all. or so i figured
                <br>
                then when i got to living where i am now, my second temporary house living away from home.
                in this location ive had no guests, i have flatmates who i really like but they dont hang out in my sty. 
                so this temporary thought can be applied to a room, a room in a vacuum, outside of everyone's world.<br> truly mine
