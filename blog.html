        a few moments shared with people, and some moments spent alone.<br>

        <br>
        i woke up late, it mustve been around
        lunchtime cause my roommates were making a lot of noise in the hallway. i waited a second for them to leave so i
        could take a pee and make myself some coffee. <br> after an hour or so my mom called me because she was going to
        a yoga
        seminar in utrecht (which is where i am living right now).<br> she offered to bring some of my stuff from
        utrecht
        back to my hometown of Zoetermeer. this has to happen because im moving out of my current apartment next month.
        <br>she picked
        me up and we drove to her seminar so i could take her car back to my apartment for free parking while she was
        doing her thing. the seminar lasted about 3 hours which was great cause i had to clean my bathroom. after
        picking her up, we went to pick up the stuff im bringing back to Zoetermeer. stuff like sir <a

<p class="p1">
its pretty cold here in my temporary home at the amsterdamsestraatweg in utrecht.
its a cold day today and im feeling very unmotivated. 
Good news though yesterday i talked to my good friend <a href="https://stupidplusplus.com/">Puk Bruinsma</a>, and we finally finalised Wacko_ For release
which is a load off my shoulders by which i mean that im so happy its finally finished. <br>
this is a project ive been working on for the past 2 years and its great to finally have something made to show to the world. <br>

<p class="p1">
id like to expand a little on temporary space and what this means to me. 
the basic idea stems from being fully alone, as a kid i spent a lot of time by myself.
i had friends at school and i had places i could go to but with my mother working a lot and my dad not being around at the time.
i had a lot of time to develop some ideas i was forming at the time in solitude.
How this relates to temporary space for me is in the idea where you cant prove anything which exists outside of your head.
your only certainty is conciousness but when you choose not to show this by speaking your ideas out loud.
then the question to me is if these thoughts are then real for anyone else but me.
<br>
then came puberty and mentally life started getting more and more of a heavy burden,
which eventually pushed me to develop a sort of dissociative state of mind.
this combined with my ideas of temporary thought convinced me that everyone else's thoughts must be worth something, 
they share them after all. or so i figured
<br>
then when i got to living where i am now, my second temporary house living away from home.
in this location ive had no guests, i have flatmates who i really like but they dont hang out in my sty. 
so this temporary thought can be applied to a room, a room in a vacuum, outside of everyone's world.<br> truly mine
