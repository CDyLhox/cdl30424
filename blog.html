            i love 3d scans as a method of capturing memories and time. <br>
            ive been making scans of places i regular or occasionally visit since 23 sept 2022, and im trying to append
            a script to show some of these places but am struggling to get threejs to work <br>
            <br>
            in the meanwhile here you have some gifs<br>
            <img src="img/gifs/laptopone2.gif" alt="mylaptop" width="30%"
                style="float: right; border: 3px solid black;">

                style="float:right; border: 3px solid black; margin-right: 2%; margin-left: 2%;">
            <br>
            anyways, if im telling the truth i dont know much about what im doing when it comes to 3d or scanning
            technology. <br>
            i know what i like and what i dont like and i know enough in blender to make some projects to explain myself
            in a 3d context. <br>
            for example i always tended to use *.fbx as model exports instaid of *.obj because the app i like to use <a
                target="_blank" href="https://scaniverse.com/">scaniverse</a> says thats a widely used model export and
            also i like that it is only one file
            compared to obj which is 2 or 3 files depending on the program. Lately though ive been exporting *.ply
            models from scaniverse also because my good friend <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/@Lucas_VCM">Lucas </a> explained to me that you can also export point
            clouds from the app. Before knowing this whenever id need a point cloud id make one out of my model via the
            blender node system putting unnecessary strain on my poor M1 chip. <br> <br>

            so not being a trained 3d artist also makes my renders WAAAY complicated and very unoptimized, this is also
            another reason why i want to use three.js instaid of using my usual P5. because i feel like threeJS is
            better optimized for 3d (or atleast id hope so) and also their material system is way nicer, but im still
            figuring out the asynchronic rendering and data flow.<br> i feel i should make a list of programs i like to
            use but maybe i wont do so within this blog post here..
        </P>
        <br>
        <div class="nerdLinks">
            anyways if youre working in blender <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BlenderKit">blenderKit</a>
            is in my opinion an essential addon to have because of the endless world of prefabs<a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7AsojmElMg">(prefabricated objects)</a> and materials. and
            speaking of blender addons <a href="https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/sapling-tree-gen/">Sapling Tree
                Gen</a> is also a great addition to your toolbelt because
            making trees is hard and this can make pretty much any tree you want for you. the issue i found was that my
            trees became very loadbaring for my poor m1 chip. i am also now finding out that this sapling tree gen
            figure im describing is a built in blender feature so themoreyouknow i guess.<br>
            then also while im at it for a shoddy javascript experience with 3d you can work pretty well in <a
                href="https://p5js.org/">p5Js</a> but if you have the time to really learn it then probably <a
                href="https://threejs.org/">threeJs</a> is a better option for 3d in specefic. theyve got some super
            cool examples on their website and when i get the time i hope to figure out how this works because to me it
            seems like a beautiful medium for audio/visual worldbuilding. anyways, i think ive said about all i really
            know about this topic and maybe even a little bit more than that. right now its 23:44 on tuesday 17th of
            december 2024 and i should really be working on an additive synthesizer im programming in c++ for a school
            project so that might be what im going to do now who knows really.. if you havent you should check out my
            Friends.html page some of my friends have some very cool websites also to check out #bringbacktheWWW or
            something and also also you should click the <a target="_blank"

            lately ive been obsessed with slow scan photography and videography. <br>
            thanks to artists like <a href="https://francoisvogel.com/en/film/158/Reer">Francios vogel</a>. ive
            expirimented with some slit scan stuff in p5js which i will try to append in this here canvas... <br>
            i tried for a while but this shit is going nowhere, ill make a video of the sketch instaid. <br>
            p5 in the site is something ive got to get working.

            <video controls width="30%" style="display: inline-block; float: right;" src="vid/slitscnanerd.mp4"></video>

            of course francoisvogel does this shit to the supreme and im nowhere near yet but i still find as an
            audiovisual exploration this to be an interesting technique. <br>
            Also speaking of scan techniques you CANNOT not talk about slow scan television this is my new favorite
            analogue technique made digital <br>
            it sounds amazing, distorts images in the most beautiful way and is also all round just super fun to
            mess around with. <br>

            is the in which i started generating sstv signals. it has a nice amount of scan type choices and theyre
            going for a little bit of a more modern design
            approach which i got to respect. i dont think you can receive sstv signals with this program though so if
            thats what youre into <br>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.qsl.net/v/ve3elb/KD6CJI-MultiScan3B/">multiscan3b</a> is nice for mac
            it offers both send and receive. ALSO, if you like good website design you should check their site i love it
            personally. DISCLAIMER: this one skews your images to an unrepairable amount<br>
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackcatsystems.com/software/sstv.html">sstv by black cat systems</a>
            may be even better for mac but a 24 euro pricetag is too much for me ngl. on the app store you can find it
            for 4 euros though which is something i had to do because i couldnt find any free alternatives for on an
            iphone. if you know any please let me know though. <br>

                What better place to blog than on a plane to the other side of the world? right now im at 9448 meters up
                into the clouds and rising slowly(or quickly depending on how you look at it) <br>
                <br><br>
                Im on my first solo flight flying to taiwan as we speak or at least as im writing. Its been a long day
                waiting for my flight at 9:30pm, but im excited because ill finally get to see my girlfriend after a
                long 4
                months. <br> <br>

                here is also a picture of me with my dad waiting on a horrific line which was forming in front of the
                checkin desk. <br>
                <img src="img/basicimg/taiwan/dadEnMe.jpg" alt="" class="gifimg" style="width: 20%;">

                why people go for these horrific lines i cant tell you first of all just let me do my thing
                and visit my girlfriend for christmas, and second of all go home people. Im joking but you know the
                plane
                leaves at a set time so rushing to get through security feels at least sort of pointless. <br>
                anyways im rambling.. While waiting for the line to thin out a little i got some coffee which they
                poured
                into an EDIBLE CUP, ive never seen anything like this in my life.
                <img src="img/basicimg/taiwan/eddibleCup.jpg" alt="ediblecup, can you believe it?" class="gifimg"
                    style="width: 10%;">

                <br> <br> <br>

                Right now im watching a movie i
                downloaded earlier at the airport. <br><br> - Gunmo.1997.DVDRip.x264.mkv<br><br>
                its an interesting movie its about some people living in a trailer park i guess, im only 21 minutes in.
                i
                saw a clip by the
                director on the instagrams
                where he said that his perspective on moves was that hedoesnt believe in plots which is something i do
                feel
                like i understand watching this movie. it feels like im watching some slice of life or more like a
                documentary about these people's life.

                <br><br>
                i also just had some 8/10 airplane food. im kind of loopy because i stayed up till too late yesterday
                working on a deadline for my school. i was programming a synthesizer in cpp but it ended up being too
                loud i
                think that ill probably need to redo it at a later point. This really bums me out though because i tend
                to
                hold myself to a very high standard. Besides i stayed up until 4 in the morning for a few days in a row
                and
                now it's all for none.<br><br>

                anyways im tring to get my mind off of it by enjoying a movie. <br>
                this isnt as technical as the other blog posts but hey its a long flight and ive got some reading
                material i
                took with me. good part is uhhhhhhhhhh<br><br>

                i like long haul flights in that sense simply because of the amount of time i have to do a bunch of
                stuff.
                see im a bit of a nightowl and more importantly i cannot sleep in vehicles so this combined with a 15
                hour
                flight means i have 15 hours to devote to whatever bullshit i want

                goodnight though at 23:50 amsterdam time on the 21st of december

            i woke up late, it mustve been around

            could take a pee and make myself some coffee. <br> after an hour or so my mom called me because she was
            going to
            a yoga
            seminar in utrecht (which is where i am living right now).<br> she offered to bring some of my stuff from

            <br>she picked

            was
            doing her thing. the seminar lasted about 3 hours which was great cause i had to clean my bathroom. after
            picking her up, we went to pick up the stuff im bringing back to Zoetermeer. stuff like sir <a

            <p class="p1">
                id like to expand a little on temporary space and what this means to me. 
                the basic idea stems from being fully alone, as a kid i spent a lot of time by myself.
                i had friends at school and i had places i could go to but with my mother working a lot and my dad not being around at the time.
                i had a lot of time to develop some ideas i was forming at the time in solitude.
                How this relates to temporary space for me is in the idea where you cant prove anything which exists outside of your head.
                your only certainty is conciousness but when you choose not to show this by speaking your ideas out loud.
                then the question to me is if these thoughts are then real for anyone else but me.
                <br>
                then came puberty and mentally life started getting more and more of a heavy burden,
                which eventually pushed me to develop a sort of dissociative state of mind.
                this combined with my ideas of temporary thought convinced me that everyone else's thoughts must be worth something, 
                they share them after all. or so i figured
                <br>
                then when i got to living where i am now, my second temporary house living away from home.
                in this location ive had no guests, i have flatmates who i really like but they dont hang out in my sty. 
                so this temporary thought can be applied to a room, a room in a vacuum, outside of everyone's world.<br> truly mine
