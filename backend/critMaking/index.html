    a project i made together with midas munsterman in the span of 3 days. during a course about Critical Making.<br><br>

    a project about snobbery in jazz music where music cannot have soul while only using a pentatonic scale. In a world where soul can only exist in chromatic music 2 people set out to change the scene. <br>
    are you often times laughed at in jam sessions, only playing the 5 notes you know? well worry no longer. for your friend is the cant-a-penta.
